# NeuroCore Dashboard (Workstream B)

This is the official front-end dashboard for the NeuroCore GenAI cluster project. It provides a read-only interface to monitor cluster nodes, jobs, and resource utilization, all built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

This dashboard is currently running in **mock data mode**. All data is being served from `/context/ClusterContext.tsx` and auto-refreshes every 5 seconds to simulate a live environment.
