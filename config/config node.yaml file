- a single YAML file describing all simulated nodes so discovery and monitoring tools can enumerate them automatically.
- Use schema identifier nodes/v1.
- For each node include: name, host, port, user, gpu_count.
- Values must correspond exactly to the Compose topology (ports 2221â€“2223, user cluster, host localhost).
- File path: config/nodes.yaml.
